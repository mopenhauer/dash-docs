You can submit articles directly into DASH using the DASH deposit interface, or you can have the Office for Scholarly Communication faciliate the process by emailing a copy of the manuscript or uploading a copy via the [Quick Submit]({{site.baseurl}}/quicksubmit) interface.

If you want to deposit items directly using the DASH interface, you will need to register for an account and receive permission to submit to a particular collection.

Click the Register link under the Submitters menu at the lower right of the page, or just go [here](http://dash.harvard.edu/register). If you are a Harvard affiliate with a Harvard ID and PIN, then click on [HUID Login](http://dash.harvard.edu/login).

Once you have provided your login information, you will be redirected to a page where you can view your submission privileges and request new ones. If you do not have a Harvard ID and PIN, then provide your email address. DASH will send you an email with further instructions. If you have an affiliation appropriate for submitting to a collection, we will add you to the list of submitters for that collection, usually within a business day. If you aren't added promptly, let us know.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I'd like my assistant or student or other person to submit articles to DASH on my behalf?

Simply fill out an [Assistance Authorization]({{site.baseurl}}/proxy) form and send it to the Office for Scholarly Communication. Your assistant can then submit on your behalf using his or her own DASH login. 

### I have a DASH account; how do I submit an article?

Once you are logged in to your DASH account, click the Submissions link under the Submitters menu. This page lists any unfinished submissions so that you can continue and complete them. You can also start a new submission by clicking the start another submission link. Submitting articles to DASH through the standard interface involves a simple process. You select a collection to submit the article to from those that you have submission permission for. Then you follow a five-step process:

1. provide an appropriate license to DASH to distribute the article
2. describe the article (title, author, etc.)
3. upload a PDF of the article itself
4. review all of the information that you provided
5. complete the submission

Once submitted, it will be checked by the OSC, and if approved, will appear in DASH. If there are any problems with the submission, you'll be notified by email and the article will be listed on your Submissions page as "unfinished" so you can correct the problems and resubmit.

### What kind of information is required to submit an article?

The only required information is the title, author names, citation, and (for some collections) your departmental affiliation(s). We recommend, however, that you provide as much further information as you can, including serial (journal, proceedings, etc.) title, ISSN, publisher name, publication year, subject keywords, the language of the article, an abstract, and links to the published article where available. The more information that you provide, the easier it is for others to find and use your article.

### What if I have other questions about DASH submission or use?
