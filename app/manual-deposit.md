_In order to ensure copyright compliance and provide thorough, indexable metadata for each article deposited in DASH, the Office for Scholarly Communication strongly recommends that authors use the [Quick Submit](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/quicksubmit) tool for submitting their works rather than depositing articles manually._

If you prefer to deposit items manually, you will need an account. Current Harvard affiliates may [go directly to the Login page](https://dash.harvard.edu/login) and sign in using HarvardKey. If you do not have a HarvardKey, you will need to [register](http://dash.harvard.edu/register) with DASH using your preferred email address. 

If you have an affiliation appropriate for submitting to a collection, we will add you to the list of submitters for that collection. DASH will also send you an email to your registered address with further instructions. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I'd like my assistant or student or other person to submit articles to DASH on my behalf?

Assistants, students, or other proxies may use the [Quick Submit](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/quicksubmit/) tool to submit articles to DASH on your behalf. You, as the author of the work, will first need to fill out an Assistance Authorization (AA) form and send it to the Office for Scholarly Communication. The AA is accessible through the Quick Submit form. 

You will only need to sign the AA once, not one time per work.

Please note that your proxy cannot sign the AA. You, as the author of the work, must do this.

### I have a DASH account; how do I submit an article?

Once you are logged in to your DASH account, click the Submissions link under the Submitters menu. This page lists any unfinished submissions so that you can continue and complete them. You can also start a new submission by clicking the start another submission link. Submitting articles to DASH through the standard interface involves a simple process. You select a collection to submit the article from those that you have permission. Then you follow a five-step process:

- Provide an appropriate license to DASH to distribute the article
- Describe the article (title, author, etc.)
- Upload a PDF of the article itself
- Review all of the information that you provided
- Complete the submission

Once submitted, it will be checked by the OSC, and if approved, will appear in DASH. If there are any problems with the submission, you'll be notified by email and the article will be listed on your Submissions page as "unfinished" so you can correct the problems and resubmit.

### What kind of information is required to submit an article?

The only required information is the title, author names, citation, and (for some collections) your departmental affiliation(s). 

We recommend, however, that you provide as much further information as you can, including serial (journal, proceedings, etc.) title, ISSN, publisher name, publication year, subject keywords, the language of the article, an abstract, and links to the published article where available. The more information that you provide, the easier it is for others to find and use your article.
