title: Deposit Your Work

All members of the Harvard research community, including students, research staff, and other faculties, are welcome to use DASH to archive and share their manuscripts where they have the rights to do so. 

If you are a Harvard faculty member in a school that has adopted an open access policy, please complete an [assistance authorization form](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/proxy/webform). This confirms your grant to Harvard of a non-exclusive license with respect to your scholarly articles as set forth in that policy.

There are several ways to submit your work to DASH:

- Email a copy of the article to the OSC at [osc@hulmail.harvard.edu](mailto:{{site.email}}).
- Use our [quicksubmit](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/quicksubmit) webform to upload an article.
- Get help from an [open access fellow]({{site.baseurl}}/fellows) who will assist you with deposits and answer questions about open access policies.
- [Manually submit]({{site.baseurl}}/manual-deposit) works directly into the repository using the DASH deposit interface.
