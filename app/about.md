title: About DASH
---

The Office for Scholarly Communication (OSC) operates the DASH repository as an effort to provide the broadest possible access to Harvard’s scholarship. 

## What DASH means for the Harvard community:

### An online home for your scholarship

DASH is the University’s central service for sharing and preserving your work. In addition to the scholarly journal articles targeted by Harvard's several open access resolutions, you may use DASH to self-archive your manuscripts and materials. DASH supports a variety of file formats, and we encourage you to deposit related materials with your manuscripts (including data, images, audio and video files, etc.)

### Enhanced discoverability and impact for your work

When you deposit your work in DASH, it becomes visible to colleagues around the world by virtue of metadata harvesting, Google Scholar, and other indexing services. Higher visibility leads to higher rates of citation and impact. When you post early versions of your work, before publication, you establish intellectual priority sooner.

### Expanded access for your colleagues

You act in your own best interests by taking part in the University’s mission to share and preserve the knowledge produced here. Because Harvard now has a prior, non-exclusive license to faculty journal articles in schools with open access policies, those faculty members are required to act accordingly when publishing journal articles, either by attaching an addendum to their publication agreement or obtaining a waiver. They then must deposit the publication in DASH.
