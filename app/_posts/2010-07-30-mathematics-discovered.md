In his article, “[Mathematical Platonism and its Opposites](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:2623649),” Barry Mazur considers whether mathematics is discovered in nature or invented by man.

Prof. Mazur examines this question not as a philosopher or a cultural historian, however, but as a mathematician—an individual inspired by structure and conversant with the felt experience of doing math.
