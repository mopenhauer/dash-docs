Overconfidence might not be such a bad trait, at least from an evolutionary standpoint. In their article, "[Evolution: Selection for Positive Illusions](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:8954812)," Profs. Matthijs van Veelen and Martin Nowak observe that most of us overestimate our abilities and underestimate our exposure to risk.

That sounds like a recipe for disaster, but thinking you're the greatest (even if you're really just "pretty good") may actually offer an evolutionary advantage.

Martin Nowak is a Professor of Mathematics and Biology, as well as the Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard. You can find a complete list of Prof. Nowak's articles in DASH [here](http://dash.harvard.edu/browse?authority=c9ed61e2b4c3f12aba1bcd18d11ceece&type=harvardAuthor).
