"Any law professor who does not get asked to sign 'scholars' briefs'," Richard Fallon observes, "is not much of a scholar." A professor in constitutional law at Harvard Law School, Fallon considers the ethical implications for legal scholars of participating in scholarly briefs in his article, "[Scholars' Briefs and the Vocation of a Law Professor](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:5371988)."

In briefs of this kind, scholars draw on both their legal knowledge and their perceived objectivity to provide support to one side of an argument before a court. Scholars may write the briefs themselves, but often they are sought out by one party or the other to endorse an already-written brief.

In his article, Prof. Fallon suggests that his colleagues ought to consider exercising some restraint when it comes to these documents: "Law professors often should say no, or at least we should say no much more frequently than many of us now do. And when we say yes---as we should sometimes---we should insist that scholars' briefs reflect higher norms of scholarly integrity than many such briefs now satisfy."
