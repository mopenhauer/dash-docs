"The Goldstone Report is, to any fair reader, a shoddy piece of work, unworthy of serious consideration by people of good will, committed to the truth."  This is how Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law and an outspoken defender of Israel, describes _The Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict_ (also known as the [Goldstone Report](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm)).  

You can consider Prof. Dershowitz's full argument in T[he Case Against the Goldstone Report: A Study in Evidentiary Bias](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3593975).
