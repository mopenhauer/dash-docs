Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Dickinson, and Harriet Beecher Stowe each contributed to an origin story of the American spirit that bound it to a Yankee, Anglo-Saxon past.

America’s cultural history, however, encompasses more than Plymouth Rock and Puritan Boston.  

In his article, [The New England Renaissance and American Literary Ethnocentrism](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3627851), Prof. Lawrence Buell, Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature, considers both the national importance and the regional particularity of New England Romantic literature.

You can find a complete list of Prof. Buell’s works in DASH [here](http://dash.harvard.edu/browse?type=harvardAuthor&authority=879af4c2f2cb8b492cd152af16d63aab).
