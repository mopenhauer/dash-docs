In her article, [Transing and Transpassing Across Sex-Gender Walls in Iran](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:2450776), Prof. Afsaneh Najamabadi examines the journalistic, biomedical, jurisprudential, and religious construction of transsexuality in Iran, arguing that the country’s “religio-legal framework of transsexuality has been productive of paradoxical, and certainly unintended, effects that at times benefit homosexuals.”
