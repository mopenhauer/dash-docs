Could the world run on wind power? "Absolutely," says Michael McElroy, Gilbert Butler Professor of Environmental Studies.

Based on a simulation of global wind fields, McElroy and his colleagues concluded:

"A network of land-based 2.5 MW turbines restricted to non-forested, ice-free, non-urban areas operating as little as 20% of their rated capacity, could supply more than 40 times current worlde consumption of electricity, more than 5 times total global use of energy in all forms."

The full study, "[Global Potential for Wind-Generated Electricity](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:5029362)," was co-authored with Xi Lu, Post-Doctoral Fellow in Atmospheric Chemistry, and Juha Kiviluoma of the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.
