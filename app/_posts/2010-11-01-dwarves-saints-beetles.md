"One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin." So begins Franz Kafka's short novel, Die Verwandlung, better known to English readers as [The Metamorphosis](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5200/5200-h/5200-h.htm).

In his article for Comparative Literature, Leland de la Durantaye, Gardner Cowles Associate Professor of English, considers Kafka's influence on the polyglot prose stylist, Vladimir Nabokov.

As a rule, the author of Lolita championed the use of concrete details in fiction and denounced mythology and symbolism. Prof. de la Druantaye observes, however, that Nabokov's interpretation of The Metamorphosis "makes Kafka's story into an allegory of the fate of the artist surrounded by uncomprehending mediocrity."
