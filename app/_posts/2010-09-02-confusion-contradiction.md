Deborah Amos reports that “after the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003, Iraq’s news media environment transformed almost overnight from the tightly controlled propaganda arm of Saddam Hussein’s rule into one of the most diverse and unrestricted news environments in the Middle East.”

In her paper, “[Confusion, Contradiction and Irony: The Iraqi Media in 2010](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4421401),” Amos describes this new media landscape and examines how Iraqis have responded to it.

She also addresses two key questions: “Is the Iraq news media an environment that encourages democracy and state building? What are the prospects to retain an open and pluralistic media landscape within Iraq’s sectarian system?”

[Deborah Amos](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100182) covers Iraq for NPR news and wrote this paper while serving as a Shorenstein Center Goldsmith Fellow in the Harvard Kennedy School.
