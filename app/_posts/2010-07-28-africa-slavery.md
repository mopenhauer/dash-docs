In his article, [The Long Term Effects of Africa's Slave Trades](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3710252), economist Nathan Nunn examines shipping records and historical documents to determine how many enslaved people were exported from each African country during the slave trade.  

Analyzing the data, he suggests that "part of Africa's current underdevelopment [can] be explained by its slave trades."
