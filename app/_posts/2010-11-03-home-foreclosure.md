Policy makers have been struggling to deal with the economic effects of the home foreclosure crisis; but what about the health effects? In their article, [Will the Public's Health Fall Victim to the Home Foreclosure Epidemic](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4553345), Gary Bennet and his colleagues consider how foreclosure, a stressful life event with a prolonged duration, might increase the risk of chronic disease.  

Bennet is Adjunct Assistant Professor of Society, Human Development & Health at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH); Reginald D. Tucker-Seeley, a co-author on the paper, is a research associate in HSPH.
