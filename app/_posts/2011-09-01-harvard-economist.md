Earlier this month, former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney assembled his panel of economic advisors.

One of the new appointees was N. Gregory Mankiw, author of the popular textbooks _Macroeconomics and Principles of Economics_ and Robert M. Beren Professor of Economics at Harvard. Mankiw is also the former chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisors and author of a popular [blog](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/) about economic policy issues.

In February 2004, the Council of Economic Advisors released a report (the _Economic Report of the President_) that sparked a contentious debate about offshore outsourcing. In a [2006 paper](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:2770517) co-authored with Prof. Phillip Swagel, Mankiw comments on the controversy. The paper "examines the differing ways in which economists and non-economists talk about offshore outsourcing" and concludes that "empirical evidence to date, while still tentativeâ€¦suggests that increased employment in the overseas affiliates of U.S. multinationals is associated with more employment in the U.S. parent than less."
