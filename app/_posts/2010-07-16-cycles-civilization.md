As Prof. Jason Ur explains in [Cycles of Civilization in Northern Mesopotamia, 4400-2000 BC](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3210514), “over a span of more than two millenia, northern Mesopotamia witnessed the emergence of urban complex society, its collapse and rebirth, and a further episode of collapse.”  

In this article, Prof. Ur examines and interprets recent archaeological data from excavations and surveys in northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey to trace the rise and fall of ancient urban places.
