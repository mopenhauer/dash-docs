Recent work by Karen L. King, the Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School, has made waves in the field of New Testament and Early Christianity studies by focusing on previously unknown, ancient Christian texts that challenge many long-held beliefs, including the question of Jesus's marital status. Among other works in DASH, Professor King's "[The Place of the Gospel of Philip in the Context of Early Christian Claims about Jesus's Marital Status](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906082545/http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11041837)" featured in New Testament Studies investigates themes of marriage within the early Christian text the Gospel of Philip. She argues that the Gospel "introduces a rich set of images into the arena of Christian ritual or sacramental theology by referring to Christian initiation as entrance into the bridal chamber… modeled paradigmatically in Jesus's marriage to Mary Magdalene." Of interest to historians and ethicists alike, her analysis uncovers rich layers of meaning that encourages the rethinking of norms ascribed to gender and sexuality in Christianity.

A supporter of Open Access at Harvard, Professor King's work has been downloaded nearly 3,000 times since mid-2012.
