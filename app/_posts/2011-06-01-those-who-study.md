Addressing a forum of Islamic scholars, William A. Graham, Dean of Harvard's School of Divinity, spoke of how "both Muslim and non-Muslim students and teachers of Islamic history and religion can participate productively in common colloquy about matters touching the Qur'an."

The talk, "[Those who study and teach the Qu'ran](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4483169)," was recently collected in Islamic and Comparative Religious Studies: Selected Writings, an anthology of Dean Graham's work, and is now available in DASH.
