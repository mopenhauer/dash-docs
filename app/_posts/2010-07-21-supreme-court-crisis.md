In their article, [The Supreme Court During Crisis: How War Affects only Non-War Cases](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4214882), Prof. Gary King and his colleagues report the results of a large-scale, quantitative study of civil rights and liberties cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court during national security crises.  

The results are surprising:  "When crises threaten the nation's security, the justices are substantially more likely to curtail rights and liberties than when peace prevails. Yet paradoxically, and in contradiction to virtually every theory of crisis jurisprudence, war appears to affect only cases that are unrelated to the war."
