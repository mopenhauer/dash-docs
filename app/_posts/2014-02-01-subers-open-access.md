_Open Access_ (MIT Press, 2012) by Peter Suber, Director of the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication and Harvard Open Access Project, has been named an Outstanding Academic Title for 2013 by _Choice_.  Published by the American Library Association, _Choice_ is read by over 22,000 librarians and scholars who make collection development and scholarly research decisions for academic libraries.  The designation of Outstanding Academic Titles recognizes works that show importance within a discipline, originality or uniqueness, and overall excellence in presentation and scholarship.  In his preface to _Open Access_, Suber describes his book as “a succinct introduction to the basics, long enough to cover the major topics in reasonable detail and short enough for busy people to read.”

Peter Suber’s book, [_Open Access_](http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10752204), is openly available in DASH.  Suber’s home page for the book includes updates and supplements as well as links to reviews, translations, and open-access editions: [http://bit.ly/oa-book](http://bit.ly/oa-book).
