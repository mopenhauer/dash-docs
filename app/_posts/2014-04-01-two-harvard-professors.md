Dr. Walter Willett, Chairman of the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, was recently featured on a [NPR segment](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/03/31/295719579/rethinking-fat-the-case-for-adding-some-into-your-diet) regarding the effectiveness and health outcomes of low-fat diet fads in the 1990s. Experts at that time recommend diets low in fat to prevent heart disease, which led to people replacing fats with carbohydrates. Dr. Willett's research countered the health benefits of a low-fat diet; Willett stated during the segment that "the high-carb, low-fat approach might not lead to fewer heart attacks and strokes." Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, an epidemiologist from the Harvard Medical School, also weighed in during the segment: "The thinking that it's OK to swap saturated fats for these refined carbs 'has not been useful advice.'"

DASH contains more than 40 works by Dr. Willett, starting with his 1995 article "[Diet, nutrition, and avoidable cancer](http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4885970)" and by Dr. Mozaffarian, an example being his 2013 article "[Do healthier foods and diet patterns cost more than less healthy options? A systematic review and meta-analysis](http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11879225)."
