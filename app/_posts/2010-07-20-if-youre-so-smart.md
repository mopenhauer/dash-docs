As Steven Shapin explains in “[Descartes the Doctor: Rationalism and Its Therapies](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3219884),” seventeenth century philosophers were painfully aware that that “the ability to prevent and cure disease, to alleviate suffering and extend human life has recurrently been used as a public test of the truth and power of philosophic and scientific systems . . .”

Thus, although Rene Descartes is best known today as “the father of modern philosophy,” he was also in the habit of doling out hands-on medical advice and making claims about his future longevity.
