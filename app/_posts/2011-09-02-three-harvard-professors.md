Roland Fryer Jr., Robert M. Beren Professor of Economics; Markus Greiner, associate professor of physics; and Matthew K. Nock, professor of psychology, have each been awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship. The fellowships, often referred to as "genius" grants, provide $500,000 for the recipient to pursue creative and intellectual projects.

You can find work by all three of these Harvard Professors in DASH. [Prof. Fryer's work](http://dash.harvard.edu/browse?authority=10745191c3cd16b621faf1a30bca09b4&type=harvardAuthor) investigates the economic and social conditions of being black in America. [Prof. Greiner](http://dash.harvard.edu/browse?authority=5a00a07e812c5ef69591a57816371b6e&type=harvardAuthor) uses lasers to cool and trap atoms in order to study quantum phenomena, and [Prof. Nock's work](http://dash.harvard.edu/browse?authority=ab93e3622f78254df0e5e2c89251698e&type=harvardAuthor) is focused on the causes of suicide and self-harm.
