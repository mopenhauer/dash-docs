Harvard Professor Robin Bernstein observes that there has long been tension between New York's center for theater and drama and the city's LGBT theater practitioners.

In "[Staging Lesbian and Gay New York](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3659696)," collected in The Cambridge Companion to the Literature of New York, Prof. Bernstein explains that "the history of scripted live performances by or about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people in New York City is the history of a vexed relationship with Broadway, the mainstream visibility it offers, and the politics and aesthetics it polices."

Robin Bernstein is an Associate Professor, jointly appointed to the African and African American Studies department and the Program of Studies in Women, Gender, and Sexuality.
