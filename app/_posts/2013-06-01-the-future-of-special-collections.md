In his article "[Five Theses on the Future of Special Collections](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:10601790)," John Overholt argues that the stewards of special collections must embrace openness, unmediated access, and the changing profiles of users. "We are privileged to be working," he states, "at the dawn of an era in which special collections will become the raw materials upon which the creative energies of the world can be exercised."

Overholt is Curator of the Donald and Mary Hyde Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson and of Early Modern Books and Manuscripts.
