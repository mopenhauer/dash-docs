In his article, "[What Is Called Ecoterrorism](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4262048)," Lawrence Buell, Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature, examines how a pair of novels, Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang (1975) and Michael Crichton's State of Fear (2004), helped to define the meaning of the term "ecoterrorism," forging it as "a rhetorical weapon not only against radicals but sometimes even mainstream reform initiatives."
