In his own time, Darwin’s theories were widely discussed in scholarly journals and amongst members of learned societies. But ordinary people in the nineteenth century were more likely to encounter Darwin’s ideas through newspapers and magazines, biographies, songs, and cartoons.

In her article, [Darwin in Caricature: A Study in the Popularisation and Dissemination of Evolution,](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3372264) Janet Browne, Aramont Professor of the History of Science, examines the portrayal of evolution in nineteenth century cartoons.
