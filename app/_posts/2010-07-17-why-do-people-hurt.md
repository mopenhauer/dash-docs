New Insights into the Nature and Functions of Self-Injury](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4134408), Professor Matthew Nock, Director of The Laboratory for Clinical and Developmental Research at Harvard University, examines why some people deliberately harm themselves without the intent to end their lives.
