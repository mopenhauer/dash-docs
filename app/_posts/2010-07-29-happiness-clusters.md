We’re accustomed to seeing happiness as something individual and internal, a state of mind that has to do with the circumstances and psychology of a particular person. Not so, say Harvard professors Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler.

According to their findings in “[Dynamic Spread of Happiness in a Large Social Network: Longitudinal Analysis Over 20 Years in the Framingham Heart Study](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3685822),” happiness is better understood as “a network phenomenon, clustering in groups of people.”  

If you’re looking for long-term happiness, the study suggests, the best strategy may simply be to surround yourself with happy people.
