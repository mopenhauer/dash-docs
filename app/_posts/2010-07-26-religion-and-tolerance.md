In their article, [Estimating the Impact of the Hajj: Religion and Tolerance in Islam's Global Gathering](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3659699), Asim Khwaja, Michael Kremer, and David Clingingsmith report that pilgrims to Mecca return with "a feeling of unity with fellow Muslims."  

This experience does not lead, however, to "antipathy toward non-Muslims," but rather to an "increased belief in peace, and in equality and harmony among adherents of different religions."

Asim Khwaja (pictured) is Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School; Michael R. Kremer is Gates Professor of Developing Societies and a member of both the Harvard Faculty of Arts & Sciences and the John F. Kennedy School of Government.
