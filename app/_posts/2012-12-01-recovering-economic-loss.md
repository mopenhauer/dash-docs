Between April 20 and July 15, 2010, over 200 million gallons of oil poured from the Deepwater Horizon rig into the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to the environmental damage, commercial fisherman and others suffered significant economic losses.


In his paper, [Liability for Economic Loss in Connection with the Deepwater Horizon Spill](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4595438), Professor of Law John C. P. Goldberg examines the liability of those responsible for the spill.

Prof. Goldberg wrote the paper as an advisory memorandum to Kenneth R. Feinberg, administrator of a $20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate victims of the spill. The document was released to the public in late November of this year.
