Ann Blair, Henry Charles Lea Professor of History, points out that information overload is not a problem particular to our digital age.

In her article, "[Reading Strategies for Coping with Information Overload, ca. 1550-1700](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3228379)", Prof. Blair discusses how, in early modern Europe, "the perception of an overabundance of books fueled the production of many more books, of especially large ones, designed to remedy the problem---from new genres like the universal bibliography and the book review to new (or not-so-new) contributions to well-established genres, including the florilegium, the dictionary, and the encyclopedic compilation."

Blair discusses this issue in depth in her new book [_Too Much to Know: Managing Scholarly Information Before the Modern Age_](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/ye-old-information-overload/) and interviewed about the book for the NPR program "Talk of the Nation."
