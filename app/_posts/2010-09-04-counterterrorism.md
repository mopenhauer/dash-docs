Terrorist groups motivated by a radical interpretation of Islam and acting without state sponsorship present a significant security challenge to the United States. In his paper, [Designing Institutions to Deal with Terrorism](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:2920114), Martin Feldstein, George F. Baker Professor of Economics, suggests that countering the threat posed by "the new terrorism" will require a restructuring of the United States' counterterrorism (CT) institutions, particularly the FBI, along with greater cooperation with the CT activities of other nations.
