Seung-Hui Cho, Nidal Hasan, and Jared Lee Loughner: three men guilty of mass shootings (at Virginia Tech, Fort Hood, and a constituents meeting held by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, respectively). In hindsight, it seems that it should have been possible to identify them as potential murderers before their horrible acts---whether by their odd or ominous behavior, or perhaps by matching them up with the psychological profiles of past mass killers.

In his piece for the online magazine Salon "[Why Psychiatrists Can't Predict Mass Murderers](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:8843162)," Professor of Psychology Richard J. McNally considers the difficult task of "distinguishing the truly dangerous from the merely odd." You can find a complete list of Prof. McNally's works in DASH [here](http://dash.harvard.edu/browse?type=harvardAuthor&authority=c5f8df45a4cc5a8a68ec3f0552db9156).
