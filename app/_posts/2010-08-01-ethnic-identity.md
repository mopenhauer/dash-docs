How does a teenager in New York City whose parents came from Haiti understand her ethnic identity? Does she identify as a black American? As Haitian? As Haitian-American?

In her article [Ethnic and Racial Identities of Second-Generation Black Immigrants in New York City](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3686134), Mary Waters, M. E. Zukerman Professor of Sociology, examines how race and class interact to define the identities of second generation West Indian and Haitian Americans in New York City.
