Does it matter to a country’s economic growth whether its citizens attend church services, or if they believe in Heaven and Hell?  

In their article, [Religion and Economic Growth across Countries](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3708464), Robert R. Barro, Paul M. Warburg Professor of Economics; and Rachel M. McCleary, Senior Research Fellow at The Harvard Kennedy School of Government’s Taubman Center, use international survey data from a broad panel of countries to investigate the effects of church attendance and religious beliefs on economic growth.

You can find a full list of Prof. Barro’s works in DASH here; Dr. McCleary’s works can be found [here](http://dash.harvard.edu/browse?type=harvardAuthor&authority=b1dec8bd7b368480555e275d628d2e85).
